Thank you for taking the time to participate in this exercise. We acknowledge your time is valuable and appreciate using some of it in our process.


Please create a program executable from the command line that when given text(s) will return a list of the 100 most common three word sequences.


For example, if I ran `ruby solution.rb pride_and_prejudice.txt` against the included txt file, the format of the first three lines of the output should look something like this,
though your values may differ.
```
i am sure - 61
i do not - 58
as soon as - 55
```

See attached .txt file for a “control” input.
